# Multi-Agent Chatroom

## Overview

The Multi-Agent Chatroom is an innovative platform designed to facilitate the exploration of social dynamics through interaction with multiple AI agents. This project aims to provide a comprehensive environment where users can observe and analyze the effects of varying emotional and cognitive intelligence levels on cooperative efforts among agents. By adjusting specific parameters, users can control the divergence and convergence of conversations, thereby gaining insights into the underlying mechanisms of social interactions in diverse settings. The platform offers both real-time interaction via a chatbox and the ability to set initial conversation prompts, making it a versatile tool for studying social dynamics.

## Highlights

- **Interactive Chatbox**: Engage with AI agents in real-time through a user-friendly chat interface.
- **Initial Conversation Prompts**: Guide the discussion by setting up initial prompts for all agents.
- **Memory Management**: Save and download the memory of the agents to analyze past interactions.
- **Exploration of Social Dynamics**: Study how agents cooperate and interact in various social settings.

## User's Instructions

### Adjustable Temperature

- Use the temperature slider to adjust the model's temperature. A higher temperature results in more creative and diverse responses, while a lower temperature produces more focused and coherent responses.

### Emotional and Cognitive Intelligence

- Observe how different levels of emotional intelligence and cognitive intelligence affect the agents' interactions. Adjust these parameters to see how they influence the conversation and cooperation among agents.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the LLaMA 3 Model**:
    - Ensure you have the LLaMA 3 model files in the `model/` directory.

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Open Your Browser**:
    - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the chatroom interface.

## Usage

### Interacting with Agents

- Use the chatbox to send messages to the agents. The agents will respond based on their configured intelligence and emotional settings.

### Setting Initial Conversation Prompts

- Set up initial conversation prompts for all agents to guide the discussion. This can be done through the interface before starting the interaction.

### Saving and Downloading Memory

- Save the memory of the agents to analyze past interactions. You can download the memory as a file for further analysis.

## Exploring Social Dynamics

- The project allows users to explore how different settings affect social interactions. Adjust the agents' emotional and cognitive intelligence to see how they cooperate and interact in various scenarios.
